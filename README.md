# Python Information
These are some of the scripts that I have had to write that make my life easier, interest me, or were needed for work.  Feel free to use or change any of these as you see fit, as they are mostly very simple proof of concepts.  

# Scripts
**Reflex Agent**
> This reflex agent is a simple AI that will clear a dirty room in two different scenarios.  This was one of the first things I was taught in "my AI Studies" class!  Whether or not it knows its starting position differentiates the "blind" bot from the regular scripts.

**Vaccine CSV Integration**
> This was a script I made as an intern that took a CSV full of vaccine information and transformed it into a usable CSV based on mappings(json) and business logic that was given to me.  For obvious reasons I did not include the JSON or the CSVs

**RegEx Password Test**
> I realized a while ago that I mostly just copy and paste regex strings, and I do not fully understand what they do most of the time.  I use them a lot in [my book display system project](https://github.com/jamespeachh/File-Management-System/), but mostly ones from the internet.  This was my attempt to fully understand regex and implement it in something that made sense to me.  Test out your passwords!
